Win a share of whatever the team wins in the hackathon! This project offers a unique opportunity to participate in the prize distribution. By scanning your NFT tag, you automatically enter a raffle for a chance to win a portion of the prize money, should our team be successful. Unlike traditional prize splits, the prize will be divided among six participants instead of five. This means that each of the six individuals will have an equal opportunity to win 1/6 of the total prize pool, ensuring that everyone involved has a chance to benefit from the team's success. Donâ€™t miss out on this exciting opportunity to be part of the action and potentially walk away with a share of the winnings!
